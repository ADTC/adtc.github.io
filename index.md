## Hey there!

### Want some neat Git aliases?

My favorite is `git l`. Oh, and `git alias` is the mother of all aliases.

```
[alias]
	alias = config --get-regexp alias
	a     = add
	aa    = add --all
	b     = branch
	bf    = branch -f
	bm    = branch -m
	c     = commit
	cb    = checkout -b
	ce    = config --global -e
	co    = checkout
	d     = diff
	ds    = diff --staged
	f     = fetch --prune
	l     = log --all --graph --pretty=format:'%C(auto)%<(90,trunc)%s %h%d'
	m     = merge
	man   = help
	p     = push
	pb    = push --set-upstream origin
	pd    = push origin -d
	pl    = pull
	s     = status -s
	st    = status
	t     = log --oneline --decorate --tags --no-walk
```

I don't have anything else here at the moment.

Why don't you head on over to [my blog](https://thehunk.blogspot.com) and read some posts?
